# Introduction
This is a concept first described to me by a friend when we were in sixth form. We have a Tic-Tac-Toe board which has Tic-Tac-Toe boards as elements 
(with a quick Google search it looks like this is also called Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe). I thought it would be a good exercise to do.

# Rules of the Game
The goal of the game is to try and win the 'outer' game of Tic-Tac-Toe, but the only way to do this is to win the regular games of tictactoe to claim those spaces as yours. 
Where you place your counters decides the next board you play on. For example, if you place your counter on the top middle of the board you are playing on, then the next move is in the board located in top middle of the outer board.
If the board you would have moved to has already been won, then you get a free choice of where to place your next counter.

Please suggest ways this project can be improved. I am still learning C++ so any constructive feedback is welcome.
